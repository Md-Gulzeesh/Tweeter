# **Tweeter App**
### Tweeter is an online multiuser tweet posting site where users can post tweets with gifs and can see each other's posts. It performs all CRUD operations.

**Note**: It will take some time to sign in and sign up at first because the backend is hosted on render.com, which takes some time to start.
